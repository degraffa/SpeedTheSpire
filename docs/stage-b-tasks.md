# Stage B Task Ledger

Execution tracker for [stage-b-design.md](stage-b-design.md) (the frozen Stage
B spec — **this file never overrides it**; on any conflict, the design doc wins
and this file gets fixed). [stage-a-design.md](stage-a-design.md) remains
frozen and in force for everything it covers. Target milestones: **M2** (oracle
bridge live, gate G4), **M3** (S1 rules complete, gate G6), **M4** (S1
verified, gate G7) — InitialPlan's milestone table, S1 = Ironclad / Act 1 /
A20.

## Orchestrator protocol

- Statuses: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked.
  Update the checkbox and the **Log** line of a task when its state changes.
- A task is **done only when its Acceptance block passes** — run the commands,
  don't infer. Tests land in the same change as the code they verify.
  Registry YAML is code: entries land with their tier-2 tests in one commit.
- Respect `Deps:`. Tasks with disjoint deliverables and satisfied deps may run
  in parallel (parallel-safe groups are marked ∥).
- **Gates** (G4–G7, continuing Stage A's numbering) are stop-the-line: nothing
  past a gate starts until the gate task is `[x]`. Phase B3/B4 content work
  additionally requires **both** G4 and G5 (design §3.2: bridge first, then
  registry migration, then mass content).
- Every commit builds and tests green: `cmake --preset debug && cmake --build
  --preset debug && ctest --preset debug` (WSL Ubuntu-2404). Run the `asan`
  preset before marking any task with new engine code done. Bridge-side
  components (fork jar, Python driver) build/run on the **Windows host** (JDK
  8 / Python 3) and are excluded from WSL CI; their acceptance commands say so
  explicitly.
- Provenance: any behavior taken from the game cites
  `ClassName.method (File.java:line)` into `D:\STS_BG_Mod\SlayTheSpireDecompiled`
  (stage-a §1). If implementation contradicts the design docs' reading of the
  Java, stop and re-read the cited source before coding around it. Once G4 is
  `[x]`, a reproduced live-game observation outranks the decompiled Java per
  design §1.3 — record every such override in the design-doc change log.
- Layout: engine as in Stage A; registry sources `registry/*.yaml`; codegen
  `tools/registry_gen/`; bridge `tools/oracle_bridge/` (fork source under
  `communicationmod-oracle/`, driver under `driver/`, translator under
  `translator/`); distributional tests `tools/dist_check/`; reports
  `tools/verify_report/` + `docs/verification/`.

## Working agreements (enforced on every task)

### Git discipline

- Work on `master` (local repo, no remote; if a remote appears, push tags too).
- **One task = one commit**, made at task completion. Gates always get their
  own commit. The ledger's checkbox + Log update goes **in the same commit**
  as the task's code — history and ledger never disagree.
- Commit message: subject `B1.2: <what changed>`; body lists the acceptance
  evidence (test target names that ran green, incl. asan; for bridge tasks,
  the Windows-host command that ran and its recorded result) and cites
  provenance for any behavior derived from the game. Claude-authored commits
  carry the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.
- Commit only from a green tree — debug **and** asan presets pass; release
  too at gates. Never `--no-verify`, never amend or rebase committed work;
  fix forward.
- Tag gates: `g4-bridge-live` (= M2), `g5-registry-live`, `g6-s1-content`
  (= M3), `g7-s1-verified` (= M4).
- **Never commit:** decompiled Java or anything from `sts-classes.jar` /
  `desktop-1.0.jar` (license hygiene — the repo re-expresses, never copies),
  built jars (incl. the fork jar), campaign artifacts (raw JSONL or translated
  traces — they live under the §7.3 data root), scratch files, `build/`.
  Exceptions, all small and reviewed: golden vectors (`tests/golden/`, as in
  Stage A), the curated CI oracle corpus (compressed, `tests/golden/
  oracle_corpus/`), promoted regression reproducers, generated verification
  reports (`docs/verification/`). The vendored fork *source* is committed
  (upstream is MIT — verified at B0.1) with its license file intact.

### Canonical references (reading order when picking up a task)

1. This ledger — the task's Deps/Deliverables/Acceptance.
2. [stage-b-design.md](stage-b-design.md), the cited §§ — the Stage B frozen
   spec.
3. [stage-a-design.md](stage-a-design.md) — frozen mechanics (RNG, state,
   queue, damage, schema) that Stage B builds on.
4. The decompiled Java at `D:\STS_BG_Mod\SlayTheSpireDecompiled` — all
   `File.java:line` citations resolve here. Read the cited method *before*
   implementing it, even when a design doc paraphrases it.
5. The live game via the oracle bridge (once G4 is `[x]`) — the runtime
   oracle. **Precedence on conflict** (design §1.3): reproduced live-game
   observation > decompiled Java > design docs > this ledger > InitialPlan.
   A live-game override needs a reproducer, a second reproduction, and a
   strip-patch audit before it wins.
6. [InitialPlan.md](../InitialPlan.md) — intent and rationale only, never
   mechanics.
7. Toolchains: JDK 8 (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_171`) builds the fork;
   Java 25 runs golden capture (stage-a A0.1); Python 3 runs the driver and
   codegen; the game + mods live in the Steam dirs cited in design §1.2.

**Discovering a conflict is stop-the-line:** fix the losing document in the
same change and record it in the task Log and the change log below (and in
the design doc's §11 / stage-a §12 when a design doc is the loser).

### Hygiene

- **No rule without its test** — the test lands in the same commit as the
  behavior. For registry entries the test is the tier-2 table test; for
  bridge/campaign code the test is the recorded acceptance run.
- Golden mismatch, fixture divergence, or **campaign divergence** =
  stop-the-line. Debugging step 1 is re-reading the cited Java; step 2 is
  auditing the fork's strip patches (design §1.3); root cause goes in the
  task Log, reproducers get promoted to regression fixtures.
- Registry ids and opcode numbers are **append-only** (design §4.4). Any
  change that would renumber an existing id is forbidden without a design-doc
  change-log entry and a schema-version bump.
- No new third-party dependencies beyond those granted in design §2.6/§4.3
  (nlohmann/json tools-only; PyYAML codegen-only) without a design-doc
  change-log entry.
- Session-start ritual for any executing agent: `git status` + `git log
  --oneline -5`; a dirty tree or a `[~]` task with an empty Log gets
  investigated before new work starts.
- At each gate: update CLAUDE.md "Current state" so a fresh session orients
  correctly without reading history.

## Phase B0 — Bridge groundwork

### B0.1 `[x]` ∥ CommunicationMod source pin + protocol survey
**Deps:** none · **Spec:** design §2.3, §2.6-2.7 · **Provenance:** local jar
(workshop 2131373661, v1.2.1); upstream `ForgottenArbiter/CommunicationMod`
**Deliverables:** upstream source fetched and pinned at the commit matching
v1.2.1, vendored to `tools/oracle_bridge/communicationmod-oracle/` with
license file (verify MIT); `tools/oracle_bridge/PROTOCOL.md` documenting, from
the actual source: message framing (stdin/stdout direction, line-delimited
JSON, `ready_for_command` semantics), the full command grammar (esp. `start`
arg syntax — character/ascension/seed, and whether seed is base-35 string or
raw long, design §2.3's open item), the complete `GameStateConverter` JSON
field catalog with a disposition for every field (schema-mapped /
ignored-with-reason / oracle-block, per design §2.6's fail-loudly policy).
**Acceptance:** PROTOCOL.md's field table covers every field emitted by
`GameStateConverter` (checked against source, not samples); the two design-doc
**[confirm at B0.1]** items are resolved and recorded in the design-doc change
log; license verified.
**Log:** Verified against source, not inferred: cloned upstream
`ForgottenArbiter/CommunicationMod`, pinned at tag `v1.2.1` = commit
`70ca84b1e8daff3eb4fe7f66775ce39926133c7f` (matches local workshop jar
2131373661 `ModTheSpire.json` v1.2.1 / sts 11-30-2020, and source `pom.xml`
v1.2.1). Vendored source-only to `tools/oracle_bridge/communicationmod-oracle/`
with `LICENSE` intact — **MIT** ("MIT License", Copyright (c) 2019
ForgottenArbiter); no jars/`.class`/build artifacts committed (only source +
626 B `Icon.png` build-input resource). Wrote `tools/oracle_bridge/PROTOCOL.md`
from source: framing (state JSON → child **stdin**, commands ← child **stdout**,
`\n`/NUL-delimited — DataWriter.java:31-33, DataReader.java:28-34,
CommunicationMod.java:222-227), `ready_for_command` = `waitingForCommand`
(GameStateListener.java:235-237), full command grammar, and the complete
`GameStateConverter` field-disposition catalogue. Both `[confirm at B0.1]`
items resolved + recorded in design §11: (1) message framing/direction;
(2) `start` seed = base-35 display string, **not** raw long
(CommandExecutor.java:353-359). Coverage: 155 `.put` sites → 141 distinct
(container,key) fields, every one has a table row + disposition; verified via
`grep -noE '\.put\("[^"]+"'`. `GameStateConverter.java` is the sole game-state
JSON emitter.

### B0.2 `[x]` ∥ Stock-jar bridge bring-up + environment audit
**Deps:** none · **Spec:** design §2.3, §1.1 · **Provenance:** config at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ModTheSpire\CommunicationMod\config.properties`
**Deliverables:** `tools/oracle_bridge/driver/echo_driver.py` — minimal child
process that logs every state JSON and can send hand-typed commands; a
documented, scriptable game-launch command line (ModTheSpire + BaseMod +
stock CommunicationMod from the workshop paths, design §1.2); one complete
manual seeded run (`start` → Neow → several floors) captured as JSONL;
recorded baseline actions/sec with the stock (unstripped) game; **profile
unlock audit** — verify the save profile is fully unlocked (bosses, cards,
relics; design §1.1) and record the evidence (or the chosen remedy) in the
Log.
**Acceptance:** captured JSONL replays cleanly through `echo_driver.py`
parsing; the same seed string typed into the game's own seeded-run UI and via
`start` produce the same floor-1 state JSON; baseline throughput number
recorded in this file.
**Log:** Verified by running, not inferred (stock unstripped game, Windows
host — excluded from WSL CI). Delivered `tools/oracle_bridge/driver/
echo_driver.py` (minimal CommunicationMod child: logs each state JSON to JSONL,
forwards operator commands from a side-channel file since the child's stdio
belongs to the game; `--verify` re-parse mode) + `driver/README.md` (config
.properties wiring + scriptable ModTheSpire launch `--skip-launcher --mods
basemod,CommunicationMod` from the workshop paths, design §1.2). One complete
manual seeded run captured — `start ironclad 20 STS12345` → Neow → floors 1-3
(single Cultist, multi-monster combats, combat/card rewards, map nav), 205
game-states. **(1)** Capture replays cleanly through `echo_driver.py --verify`:
418 records, 205 recv, 205 parsed OK, 0 errors. **(2)** Seed cross-check:
`start …STS12345` and the game's own seeded-run **UI** with `STS12345` both
yield seed long **1790052133945** and a **byte-identical** normalized floor-0
Neow state (11 cards, 56 map nodes; deck/relics/map/hp/gold all equal;
per-instance `uuid`s dropped per PROTOCOL.md). Both paths share
`SeedHelper.getLong`; `STS12345 ↔ 1790052133945` round-trips exactly. **(3)**
Baseline throughput (stock, unstripped): **~0.36 states/s** (stepper-paced,
dominated by unsuppressed combat animations — the ≥5/s floor is the
strip-patched fork target, B1.3). **Profile unlock audit — PASS:** fully
unlocked at the pool gate. All 60 unlock-gated cards/relics in
`UnlockTracker.refresh()` have `STSUnlocks` flag=2, so `lockedCards`/
`lockedRelics` are empty (`addCard`/`addRelic` lock only keys `!= 2`) →
complete pools; every Act-1 boss beaten (`STSAchievements`); A20 launches. The
`IRONCLADUnlockLevel=3` meta-counter does **not** gate run pools —
`isCardLocked` reads per-card flags, not the level (source `CardLibrary.
addRedCards`, `UnlockTracker.addCard`/`refresh`); profile left untouched (no
save edit). Config.properties and all JSONL captures live under the §7.3 data
root `D:\STS_BG_Mod\_oracle_data`, uncommitted; the stepper that drove the
capture is a throwaway data-root helper, not the committed driver.

---

## Phase B1 — The oracle fork, driver, translator (Gate G4 = M2)

### B1.1 `[x]` Fork build pipeline
**Deps:** B0.1, B0.2 · **Spec:** design §2.4
**Deliverables:** JDK-8 build script (`tools/oracle_bridge/build_fork.ps1` or
equivalent) compiling the vendored fork against `desktop-1.0.jar` +
ModTheSpire + BaseMod from the local install; jar output to a non-committed
location ModTheSpire picks up; fork modid distinct from upstream
(`CommunicationMod-oracle`) so both can't load together confusingly.
**Acceptance:** fork jar, with zero behavioral patches yet, reproduces B0.2's
captured run byte-for-byte (same seed, same script → same JSONL states);
build script is deterministic and documented in the fork README.
*(Amended 2026-07-22 — the B0.2 capture is timing-contaminated and not
cleanly reproducible; see the change log. Satisfied as: fork == stock
byte-identical on the same derived script, with stock-determinism control and
B0.2 anchors.)*
**Log:** Verified by running, not inferred (Windows host — excluded from WSL
CI). Delivered `tools/oracle_bridge/build_fork.ps1`, a no-Maven JDK-8
pipeline: stages sources with the upstream pom's gson shade relocation applied
textually (`com.google.gson`→`com.autoplay.gson`; vendored sources untouched),
packages the already-relocated gson 2.8.5 classes **extracted from the stock
workshop jar** (byte-identical gson bytecode to the B0.2 baseline, no new
dependency), compiles with `javac -g` (**required** — ModTheSpire resolves
`@SpirePatch` parameter names from the LocalVariableTable; without `-g`
patching dies with "Illegal patch parameter: Cannot determine name"), and
writes a **deterministic jar** (ordinal-sorted entries, pinned timestamps, no
manifest): `-CheckDeterminism` runs the full pipeline twice → byte-identical,
sha256 `6AB875C8EA374C9014643CB4BDC3FA6E93264D0C8DD3B7BD7C23DAAB2323FD16`.
Fork identity: modid `CommunicationMod-oracle` (ModTheSpire.json made concrete
— the maven `${…}` placeholders died with the maven build); `SpireConfig`
name untouched so the B0.2 driver wiring works as-is; docs in
`communicationmod-oracle/README-oracle.md` + layout map in
`tools/oracle_bridge/README.md`. Deploys to `<game>\mods\` (jar never
committed). Launch notes: `--skip-launcher --mods
basemod,CommunicationMod-oracle` works; run MTS under the game's **bundled JRE
8** (`<game>\jre\bin\java.exe`) — system Java 25 was being upgraded by a
concurrent process mid-task, which killed the first launch's JVM.
**Acceptance evidence:** B0.2's capture turned out timing-contaminated — its
stepper re-sent `end` 7× during one slow monster-turn window (send seqs
37-44); the game queued extras, so the recorded turn-3 state shows
`times_damaged`=5 / HP 45 while the turn-2 decision state was never dumped.
No clean state-paced replay can reproduce that. Controlled experiment on the
**derived 205-command effective script** (8 noise sends dropped, the one
invisible `end` re-inserted; replayer sends each command only on a fresh
`ready_for_command` state): **(1)** stock determinism — two independent
stock-jar game sessions → 206/206 normalized states byte-identical (uuid
dropped per PROTOCOL.md, the only nondeterministic field); **(2)** **fork ==
stock: 206/206 normalized states byte-identical** (seed STS12345, A20
Ironclad, Neow → floor-3 reward); **(3)** anchors to the B0.2 capture:
floor-0 Neow state byte-identical (seed long 1790052133945), first 18 states
byte-identical (everything pre-contamination), and the whole-run floor/screen
trajectory identical modulo the one extra turn-2 state. Fork capture parses
clean (`echo_driver.py --verify`: 206 recv, 0 errors). Replay/compare helpers
(`replay_b11.py`, `compare_b11.py`) are data-root throwaways per the B0.2
stepper precedent. WSL suite untouched: 140/140 green in debug + asan.

### B1.2 `[x]` Oracle state block
**Deps:** B1.1 · **Spec:** design §2.5 (the frozen 10-row field inventory) ·
**Provenance:** AbstractDungeon.java:149-161; Random.java:17-18;
NeowEvent.java:62/289/363; AbstractDungeon.java:247-250;
AbstractRoom.java:100-101; EventHelper.java:88-92; ShopScreen.java:100-102;
AbstractDungeon.java:182-184, 1221-1256; monster move-history fields (read
here)
**Deliverables:** fork patch emitting the `"oracle"` JSON block (all §2.5
rows: 13 dungeon streams + Neow rng as `{counter,s0,s1}`, both pity counters,
event pity floats, purgeCost, remaining event/shrine/special lists, relic
pool orders ×5, per-monster move history, seed/floor/act/ascension anchors)
behind a fork config flag; PROTOCOL.md updated with the block's schema.
**Acceptance:** for one scripted run: relicRng counter reads exactly 5 after
dungeon init (AbstractDungeon.java:1237-1241); floor-scoped stream `(s0,s1)`
at floor N equals the sim's `floor_stream(seed, N)` (tier-1-tested) for
floors 1-3; blizzardPotionMod visibly ratchets across two combat rewards;
event-list contents shrink after an event fires. Each checked from the dump,
recorded in the Log.
**Log:** Verified by running, not inferred (Windows host — excluded from WSL
CI). Delivered the oracle-state-block fork patch: `GameStateConverter`
gains `getOracleState()`/`rngToJson()` appending a single `"oracle"` key to
every in-dungeon dump, gated by a new fork config flag `oracleBlock` (default
true; `config.properties` + a mod-settings toggle) so with the flag off the
fork output is byte-identical to stock (the B1.3 strip-equivalence baseline).
The block carries **every** design-§2.5 row: the 14 RNG streams as
`{counter,s0,s1}` — 7 run-scoped (`monsterRng eventRng merchantRng cardRng
treasureRng relicRng potionRng`), 5 floor-scoped (`monsterHpRng aiRng
shuffleRng cardRandomRng miscRng`), `mapRng`, and `neowRng`
(`NeowEvent.rng`, key absent until the blessing screen) — plus
`cardBlizzRandomizer`, `blizzardPotionMod`, the three `eventPity` floats
(`monster/shop/treasure`), `purgeCost`, the three remaining-pool lists
(`eventList/shrineList/specialOneTimeEventList`), the five `relicPools`
orders, per-monster `monster_move_history` (combat only), and
seed/floor/act/ascension anchors. `s0`/`s1` come from public
`Random.random.getState(0/1)` (RandomXS128 seed0/seed1); the two private
`EventHelper` pity floats use the sanctioned `ReflectionHacks` fallback
(design §2.5), everything else is public/static — **no other reflection
needed** on the 11-30-2020 build. PROTOCOL.md gains §5 (the block's full
schema). **Provenance** (all read in full before coding): AbstractDungeon.java
:149-161 (stream fields), :247-250 (cardBlizz), :182-184 (event/shrine/special
lists), :1221-1256 (5 `relicRng.randomLong()` pool shuffles), :1747-1751 (floor
reseed = `Random(seed+floorNum)`); Random.java:17-18; NeowEvent.java:62/289/363;
AbstractRoom.java:100-101; EventHelper.java:88-92; ShopScreen.java:100-102,
278-292; AbstractMonster.java:106; RandomXS128.getState.
**Acceptance — one fixed 205-cmd scripted run (seed STS12345, A20 Ironclad,
Neow→floor-3 reward; B1.1's derived script) + one short adaptive second run for
the event observation the fixed path can't reach (its map only visits monster
rooms; its one `?` room rolls MONSTER on this seed):**
**(1)** `relicRng.counter` = **5** at the first in-dungeon dump (floor-0 Neow),
exactly the 5 init pool shuffles.
**(2)** floor-scoped `(s0,s1)` == sim `floor_stream(1790052133945, N)` **bit-for-bit**
(read off `cardRandomRng` at `counter==0`, pristine per-floor reseed), floors
1/2/3: floor 1 `s0=7342732389453056061 s1=-1677929205632241533`, floor 2
`s0=-6609920522105378709 s1=-9206057524216559371`, floor 3
`s0=1660650329036603239 s1=1975031184179605387` — each equal to the sim's
tier-1-tested derivation (WSL probe over `include/sts/engine/rng_stream.hpp`
`floor_stream`).
**(3)** `blizzardPotionMod` ratchets across the combat rewards: 0 (Neow) → **10**
(floor-1 reward, +10 no-drop) → 0 (floor-2 reward, potion dropped→reset) → **10**
(floor-3 reward, +10) — two visible +10 ratchets.
**(4)** `eventList` shrinks **11→10** when an event fires: floor-5 `?`-room rolled
EVENT and removed **"Liars Game"** (`eventRng.counter` 0→3). The fixed run's
floor-2 `?` rolled MONSTER (`eventRng.counter` 0→1, `room_type=MonsterRoom`, no
list change) — the oracle correctly captured the non-event roll too.
Windows-host commands: `build_fork.ps1` (jar sha256
`7A735C1F1B16368DF4B7E68042EFC23533708FBA08263592CF2C4302552E9960`, deployed to
`<game>\mods\`, never committed); game launched under the bundled JRE 8
(`<game>\jre\bin\java.exe … --skip-launcher --mods basemod,CommunicationMod-oracle`);
scripted via `echo_driver.py` + data-root throwaway feeders
(`feed_b12.py`/`autopilot2_b12.py`/`analyze_b12.py`) per the B0.2/B1.1
precedent; captures under the §7.3 data root, uncommitted. WSL suite green:
**140/140 in debug + asan** (no engine change; tree verified green to commit).
Spec note resolved: design §2.5 row 6 names `ShopScreen.purgeCost` — emitted as
`purgeCost`; the relic-adjusted `actualPurgeCost` is already the stock
`purge_cost` shop-screen field, so both are observable. B1.3 note: with
`oracleBlock=false` the dump has no `oracle` key (the strip-equivalence
baseline); block size ~3.85 KB/dump at floor 0 (the 5 full relic-pool id-string
lists dominate; shrinks as pools pop).

### B1.3 `[ ]` Rendering-strip / fast-forward patches
**Deps:** B1.2 · **Spec:** design §2.2 (semantic guard; throughput floor)
**Deliverables:** the strip patch family (draw suppression, animation-time
collapse, fast update cadence) in the fork, individually toggleable via fork
config; throughput measurement script in the driver.
**Acceptance:** ≥ 20 seeds × scripted multi-floor runs: oracle dumps (incl.
the full §2.5 block) are **byte-identical** with strip patches on vs. off;
sustained throughput ≥ 5 actions/sec (floor), number recorded here; if the
floor is unreachable, stop and amend design §2.2/§8 per its own rule before
proceeding.
**Log:** —

### B1.4 `[ ]` Campaign driver
**Deps:** B1.2 · **Spec:** design §2.7, §3.3 (generators), §7.2
**Deliverables:** `tools/oracle_bridge/driver/` grows into the real driver:
seeded A20 Ironclad starts; action-script execution (scripted sequences) and
random-legal generation from the game's own accepted-command set; JSONL
artifacts per design §2.7 (version-stamped header incl. fork-jar hash, seed
both encodings); crash detection + game restart + campaign resume; batch
mode over seed lists.
**Acceptance:** unattended 10-seed campaign (full Act-1 runs, random-legal)
completes without manual intervention, surviving at least one deliberately
induced game kill mid-campaign; artifacts validate against the PROTOCOL.md
schema.
**Log:** —

### B1.5 `[ ]` Translator (JSON → binary schema)
**Deps:** B1.4 · **Spec:** design §2.6 · **Provenance:** PROTOCOL.md field
table (B0.1)
**Deliverables:** `tools/oracle_bridge/translator/` C++ target (nlohmann/json,
tools-only per the §2.6 grant): campaign JSONL → trace files; the full
field-disposition table enforced (unknown field = hard error); skeleton-set
hand table for id mapping (replaced by generated tables after B2.2);
`RunState` fields Stage A left placeholder get their translation where the
schema already has storage — fields needing **new** RunState storage are
listed in the Log for B4.3 (they translate to the trace only after B4.3
lands; the translator versions its output accordingly).
**Acceptance:** gtest `translator_test` (WSL, runs on committed sample JSONL):
every §2.5 oracle field lands in the right schema field bit-for-bit
(counters, s0/s1, pity values); an artifact with an unknown field is refused;
round-trip stability (translate twice → identical traces).
**Log:** —

### B1.6 `[ ]` Diff-harness run-level + oracle adapter
**Deps:** B1.5 · **Spec:** design §3.3 · **Provenance:** stage-a §8 (format),
A6.1 (adapter seam)
**Deliverables:** trace format v2: `state_kind` discriminator (combat/run
records in one container), `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump, loader refusal unchanged;
differ gains RunState field groups (deck, relics, potions, gold, map, pool
orders, pity counters, 8 run-level streams) with named-field output;
`CommunicationModOracleAdapter` (file-based over translated traces, both
state kinds); `replay` generalized to seed a sim replay from any translated
`RunState` (combat replay from run context lands with B4.4 — here the
adapter + format only).
**Acceptance:** `differ_test` extended: synthetic divergence in every new
RunState field group caught and named; v1 traces (A6.2 fixtures) still load
via a compatibility read or are regenerated by their checked-in generator
with zero diff against the engine (choose in Log; stage-a fixtures must not
be hand-edited); adapter answers `query` correctly for prefix/unknown-seed
cases over a translated campaign sample.
**Log:** —

### G4 `[ ]` **Gate: oracle bridge live (M2)** — tag `g4-bridge-live`
**Deps:** B1.3, B1.6
Checklist (all must hold, evidence linked in Log):
- [ ] 20-seed campaign: every dumped state translates with zero unknown-field
      errors; all 14 stream counters + both pity counters + event pity floats
      + purgeCost present in every record.
- [ ] RNG cross-check across the campaign: floor-scoped stream `(s0,s1)` at
      every floor entry matches sim `floor_stream(seed, floor)`; `mapRng`
      state matches `map_stream(seed, 1)`; relicRng counter = 5 at init —
      i.e. the run-scoped/act-scoped derivations hold against the **live
      game**, not just golden vectors.
- [ ] Strip-patch equivalence (B1.3 acceptance) re-confirmed on the final
      fork build; throughput ≥ 5 actions/sec recorded.
- [ ] WSL CI untouched and green (bridge code adds no CI dependency on the
      game).
Then: update CLAUDE.md "Current state".

## Phase B2 — Registry system + skeleton migration (Gate G5) — ∥ with Phase B1

### B2.1 `[x]` ∥ Registry schema + codegen tool
**Deps:** none (Stage A G3) · **Spec:** design §4.1-4.3
**Deliverables:** `registry/` YAML schemas for all 8 domains (design §4.1)
with the §4.2 entry shape; `tools/registry_gen/gen.py` (Python 3 + PyYAML)
emitting: the id enums, constexpr effect-program tables (A4.3's exact
`CardDef`/step shape), `game_id`↔enum string tables, and the row-count
manifest; CMake custom-command wiring (generated headers under the build
tree, never committed); generator determinism (sorted iteration, no
timestamps).
**Acceptance:** gtest `registry_gen_test`: running the generator twice
produces byte-identical output; a YAML entry with a duplicate or reused id
fails generation with a clear error; generated headers compile standalone.
**Log:** Verified by running, not inferred: `cmake --preset {debug,asan} &&
build && ctest` in WSL Ubuntu-2404 — **137/137 green in both presets** (Stage A
baseline 131 + 6 new `registry_gen_test` cases:
`RegistryGen.{DeterministicByteIdentical, DuplicateIdFailsWithClearError,
EnumIdsMatchEngine, CardTableMatchesEngine, GameIdTablesRoundTrip,
ManifestCounts}`). `registry/` seeded with all 8 domains (5 cards STRIKE=1..
POMMEL_STRIKE=5, 3 powers STRENGTH=1..WEAK=3, Jaw Worm JAW_WORM=1; the other 5
valid-but-empty); `tools/registry_gen/gen.py` (Python 3 + PyYAML) emits the
id enums, the `CardDef`/step table in cards.hpp's exact shape, the
`game_id`↔enum string tables, and the row-count manifest — deterministic
(sorted, no timestamps, byte-identical across two runs) with append-only ids
re-pinned by `static_assert`. CMake custom-command wiring emits headers under
`<build>/generated/` (never committed; `.gitignore` extended). Non-breaking:
the engine still uses its hand tables (`types.hpp`/`cards.hpp` untouched); the
generated `sts::registry` tables are proven byte-equal to them by the test, so
B2.2's swap is zero-change. Provenance: `Strike_Red`/`Defend_Red`/`Bash`/
`ShrugItOff`/`PommelStrike`.use + ID; `StrengthPower`/`VulnerablePower`/
`WeakPower` POWER_ID; `JawWorm` stat/getMove branches (all read in full).

### B2.2 `[x]` Skeleton migration onto the registry
**Deps:** B2.1 · **Spec:** design §3.2, §4.4 (the stop-the-line decision) ·
**Provenance:** types.hpp / cards.hpp / monster_jaw_worm.hpp as of
`m1-walking-skeleton`
**Deliverables:** the 5 skeleton cards, 3 powers, and Jaw Worm expressed as
registry YAML (ids pinned to their current numeric values: STRIKE=1…
POMMEL_STRIKE=5, STRENGTH=1..WEAK=3, JAW_WORM=1); generated enums replace
`types.hpp`'s hand enums (Action/ActionVerb stay hand-written); `cards.hpp`'s
hand table replaced by the generated table; Jaw Worm stats/moves from
`monsters.yaml` (AI selection may stay native per design §4.2 — the move
*effects* and A17/A7 stat columns are data); `static_assert` pins on every
migrated id in the generated headers.
**Acceptance:** **Stage A's full suite (131 tests) and all 20 combat fixtures
pass in debug + asan with zero test-file edits and zero fixture
regeneration** (design §4.4 acceptance, verbatim). `sizeof(CombatState)`
unchanged; `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged.
**Log:** Verified by running, not inferred: full clean rebuild in WSL
Ubuntu-2404 (`rm -rf build && cmake --preset {debug,asan} && build && ctest`) —
**140/140 green in both presets**: Stage A's 131 baseline tests (incl. all 20
combat fixtures, `FixtureOracle.AllFixturesReplayWithZeroDiffs` /
`FixtureCountIsAtLeastTwenty`) + B2.1's 6 registry_gen cases + 3 new
`RegistryGen.{EngineReExportsGeneratedTables, MonsterTableMatchesJava,
DuplicateMoveIdFailsWithClearError}` — with **zero test-file edits and zero
fixture regeneration** (no Stage A test or `tests/golden/` byte changed; only
the B2.1 registry-gen test TUs grew the new monster-table cases).
`sizeof(CombatState)` = 3504 and `SCHEMA_VERSION` = 1, compile-probed identical
before/after the swap. Migration shape: `types.hpp`'s
CardId/PowerId/MonsterId/RelicId are now using-aliases of the generated
`sts::registry` enums (ids re-pinned by generated `static_assert`s;
Action/ActionVerb stay hand-written); `cards.hpp` re-exports the generated
`CardDef` table (kStrike…kPommelStrike, `card_def`) with drift pins holding
`sts::registry::Opcode` byte-equal to interp.hpp's; Jaw Worm's HP range and
move-effect amounts are per-ascension-tier columns in `monsters.yaml`
(base/a2/a7/a17, each citing its JawWorm.java:79-104 branch; move ids
CHOMP=1/BELLOW=2/THRASH=3 per :65-67), emitted by gen.py's new
`monster_table.hpp` (`MonsterDef` with constexpr last-matching-threshold tier
lookups) and enqueued data-driven by `jaw_worm_take_turn` at the skeleton's
fixed A20 — getMove *selection* stays native per design §4.2. No dual system:
the hand enums/tables are deleted;
`RegistryGen.EngineReExportsGeneratedTables` pins engine == registry
entity-for-entity. Build: `tools/registry_gen` now precedes `src/engine`
(unconditional); `sts_engine` links `registry_generated` PUBLIC with an
explicit codegen dependency, so generated headers exist before any engine TU
compiles.

### G5 `[x]` **Gate: registry live** — tag `g5-registry-live`
**Deps:** B2.2
All Stage A tests green through the generated path in debug, asan, release;
hand tables deleted (no dual system); manifest reports exactly the skeleton
row counts; CI runs the generator (PyYAML available in the CI image — extend
the workflow in this commit). Nothing in Phases B3/B4 starts before G4 **and**
G5 are both `[x]`. Then: update CLAUDE.md "Current state".
**Log:** Verified by running, not inferred (orchestrator re-ran every check on
integrated master `5180930`). **All 140 tests green through the generated path
in debug, asan, AND release** (each a clean `rm -rf build` config→build→ctest;
release run via `ctest --test-dir build/release` since there is no release
test-preset — build/test both exit 0). **Hand tables deleted / no dual system:**
`types.hpp` has no `enum class CardId/PowerId/MonsterId/RelicId` bodies left
(all `using`-aliased to `sts::registry`), `cards.hpp`/`monster_jaw_worm.hpp`
re-export the generated tables; `RegistryGen.EngineReExportsGeneratedTables`
pins engine == registry entity-for-entity. **Manifest = exactly the skeleton
counts:** cards=5, powers=3, monsters=1, relics/potions/events/encounters/a20=0
(total 9), read from `build/release/generated/sts/registry/manifest.hpp`.
**CI runs the generator:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` install step gains
`python3-yaml` (PyYAML for the system `python3` that CMake's
`find_package(Python3)` selects); the literal CI flow was reproduced locally
(`cmake -S . -B build/ci -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` → build → ctest)
— configure/build/test all exit 0, 140/140, and all five generated headers
(`ids/card_table/monster_table/game_ids/manifest.hpp`) are emitted under the
build tree (never committed). `SCHEMA_VERSION`=1 and `sizeof(CombatState)`=3504
unchanged. **Note:** B3/B4 remain blocked — they require **both** G4 and G5,
and G4 (oracle bridge) is not yet reached.

---

## Phase B3 — Combat content closure (all tasks additionally gated on G4 + G5)

Each content task ships: registry entries with provenance (every cited
`use()`/ctor/`getMove` **read in full** before encoding), any new
powers/opcodes those entries need (append-only numbering), tier-2 table tests
per entry, a directed tier-3 script added to the campaign script library, and
— once the run layer exists — at least one oracle spot-diff exercising the
batch. Until run-level replay lands (B4.4), oracle spot-diffs for combat
content use combat-state comparison inside bridge runs whose context the
translator can seed (B1.6), or are deferred to the batch's campaign debut and
noted in the Log.

### B3.1 `[ ]` Interpreter/card-mechanics extensions
**Deps:** G4, G5 · **Spec:** design §5.1; stage-a §5-§6 · **Provenance:**
AbstractCard/AbstractPlayer use/cost paths; UseCardAction; read at task
**Deliverables:** engine support the full red set needs beyond the skeleton:
X-cost (energy-consume) cards, multi-hit and ALL_ENEMY targeting,
`CardInstance.flags` bits for exhaust/ethereal/innate/unplayable/retain,
upgrade plumbing (two-row registry lookup by `upgrade` bit), temporary/
conditional cost modifiers, and the `SHUFFLE_IN`/discard-pile card-creation
paths status cards need. New opcodes appended (≥9), documented in interp.hpp.
**Acceptance:** gtest coverage per mechanic in constructed states (incl.
X-cost consuming all energy, AOE hitting only live monsters, hand-cap
interaction with created cards); all existing tests green.
**Log:** —

### B3.2 `[ ]` Power-hook framework completion
**Deps:** B3.1 · **Spec:** stage-a §5.3-5.5 hook order (frozen) ·
**Provenance:** AbstractPower hook inventory; GameActionManager.java:214-249,

**Deliverables:** the full hook set real content triggers (onPlayCard,
onExhaust, onCardDraw, atEndOfTurn pre/post-card, onAttack/onAttacked,
onDamageReceived, atStartOfTurn pre/post-draw, onDeath…) wired through the
pump in the frozen §5.2/§5.3 order, replacing A4.3's no-op stubs; power
registry schema columns for hook→effect-program bindings; native-hook escape
hatch.
**Acceptance:** ordering tests: player powers → monster powers → relics
(acquisition order) → hand/discard/draw cards on card play (stage-a §5.3);
end-of-turn hand triggers before discard (stage-a §5.4); regression: full
suite green (the stub removal must not shift any fixture).
**Log:** —

### B3.3 `[ ]` ∥ Red commons — attacks

## Phase B4 — The run layer (Gate G6 = M3)

### B4.1 `[ ]` Map path generation
**Deps:** G4, G5 · **Spec:** design §5.6 · **Provenance:**
MapGenerator.java:23, 62-77, 157-190, 270-276; AbstractDungeon.java:510-540

      tests (scripted check, `tools/verify_report/`).
- [ ] Sim-only soak: 1,000-seed random-policy full Act-1 runs complete (win,
      die, or legal-action exhaustion — never an assert/illegal state) in
      debug + asan.
- [ ] Oracle spot campaign: ≥ 20 full-run seeds, Neow through boss reward,

## Phase B5 — Verification campaigns + S1 exit (Gate G7 = M4)

### B5.1 `[ ]` ∥ Sim self-replay fuzz soak
**Deps:** B4.4 · **Spec:** design §7.1(2); stage-a §2 (replay-twice memory
guard)
**Deliverables:** `tools/fuzz/` sim-side fuzzer: random-legal + heuristic
policies (design §3.3's E0 stand-ins, implemented here) over seed sweeps;
every run replayed twice, final-state hashes compared; assert/hash-mismatch
triage output with reproducers; overnight-runnable script.
**Acceptance:** ≥ 10M actions across ≥ 10k seeds, zero nondeterminism, zero
asserts, asan-clean sample (≥ 1 % of runs under asan); numbers recorded here.
**Log:** —

### B5.2 `[ ]` ∥ Oracle campaign automation
**Deps:** B1.4, B4.4 · **Spec:** design §7.1-7.3
**Deliverables:** campaign orchestration (seed sharding, nightly schedule,
resume, artifact root fixed per §7.3, translation + diffing pipeline run as
one command); triage queue (divergence → reproducer → this ledger/change-log
workflow); promoted-reproducer corpus layout.
**Acceptance:** one unattended overnight campaign (≥ 50 seeds) runs
end-to-end (game → JSONL → traces → diff reports) without intervention;
throughput and diff counts land in a generated report.
**Log:** —

### B5.3 `[ ]` ∥ Tier-4 distributional suite
**Deps:** G6 · **Spec:** design §3.4 (analytic-first scope)
**Deliverables:** `tools/dist_check/`: the §3.4 analytic expectation set
(encounter weights, compositions, rarity+pity dynamics, potion ratchet,
chest tables, ?-room pity, relic/potion tier rolls, map quotas) with
chi-square/exact tests over ≥ 10k sim seeds; the ≥ 200-run oracle-harvested
spot comparison.
**Acceptance:** all analytic tests pass at pre-registered significance
(document the correction for multiple comparisons in the tool README —
choose and justify); oracle spot set shows no flagged aggregate; failures
are stop-the-line divergences, not tuning targets.
**Log:** —

### B5.4 `[ ]` Verification report + CI corpus
**Deps:** B5.2 · **Spec:** design §7.4-7.5, §7.1(1)
**Deliverables:** `tools/verify_report/` (diffs per million actions,
divergence inventory, per-registry-row oracle-sighting + tier coverage join
via `game_id`); latest report committed under `docs/verification/`; the
curated 50-seed CI corpus (compressed translated traces +
zero-diff-replay gtest wired into the existing CI matrix).
**Acceptance:** CI runs the 50-seed replay smoke in seconds and fails on an
injected synthetic divergence (proven once, then reverted); report
regenerates deterministically from campaign artifacts.
**Log:** —

### B5.5 `[ ]` Throughput floors
**Deps:** G6 · **Spec:** design §8(4); InitialPlan §0.2 floors
**Deliverables:** benchmark additions: full-combat/sec/core (random policy)
and full-run/sec whole-machine on `bench_advance`'s pattern; methodology
notes (random-policy stand-in for 25-sim MCTS, per design §8).
**Acceptance:** release-preset numbers recorded here: ≥ 50k combat
steps/sec/core, ≥ 300 combats/sec/core, ≥ 0.4 runs/sec whole-machine — or a
stop-the-line design-doc amendment with profiling evidence (fast-but-wrong
is death; slow-but-honest gets a Stage C plan).
**Log:** —

### G7 `[ ]` **Gate: S1 verified (M4)** — tag `g7-s1-verified`
**Deps:** B5.1-B5.5, G6
The design §8 bar, checked literally (evidence linked in Log):
- [ ] ≥ 1,000,000 oracle-diffed actions across ≥ 2,000 seeds, zero
      un-triaged diffs (campaign reports).
- [ ] ≥ 10M sim-side fuzz actions, zero nondeterminism/asserts (B5.1).
- [ ] 100 % tier-2 registry coverage (manifest check, re-run at gate).
- [ ] Every a20.yaml row verified per design §8(3).
- [ ] Throughput floors hold (B5.5 numbers).
- [ ] Tier-4 suite green (B5.3).
Then: update CLAUDE.md "Current state"; open Stage C planning (perf
hardening) and the S2 scope conversation as fresh planning exercises.

## Change log

- 2026-07-22 — B1.1 acceptance amended (ledger is the losing document; fixed
  in the same change per the working agreement). "Reproduces B0.2's captured
  run byte-for-byte" is unsatisfiable as written: the B0.2 capture is
  timing-contaminated (queued stepper `end`-resends produced a game history —
  5 monster hits by "turn 3" — that no clean state-paced replay can recreate;
  root cause in the B1.1 Log). Replaced with the controlled equivalent: two
  stock-jar runs of the derived effective script must be byte-identical
  (determinism control), the fork run must be byte-identical to stock on the
  same script, and the run must anchor to the B0.2 capture (Neow floor-0
  state, pre-contamination 18-state prefix, floor/screen trajectory). The
  B1.3 strip-equivalence and G4 acceptance style (fork-vs-fork A/B on
  identical scripts) is unaffected.
- 2026-07-17 — v0.1 created from stage-b-design.md v0.1 (§2-§8 → phases
  B0-B5). Task counts: 57 tasks + 4 gates (G4-G7, continuing Stage A's gate
  numbering; G4=M2, G6=M3, G7=M4). Card/monster/relic batch enumerations
  marked "enumerate at task start" are counted from the CardRarity/RelicTier
  greps recorded in design §5 — the named example lists in B3.x are
  orientation, not authority; the source enumeration at task start wins.
